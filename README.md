# Teacher-Bot
The teacher bot is a conversational AI chatbot developed using the Rasa framework, designed to assist teachers in communicating effectively with parents. The chatbot will automate the process of sending notifications about student absences, academic results, and institutional announcements via SMS through Twilio integration. Upon initiating a conversation, the chatbot will greet the teacher, providing a friendly interface for interaction. Teachers can easily input the necessary information, such as the studentâ€™s name, and the chatbot will format and send the message directly to the specified phone number. This proposed solution aims to reduce the communication burden on teachers and enhance the responsiveness of parents regarding their child's academic activities
